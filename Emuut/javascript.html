            <p>Embryonic stem cells have been an excellent source of information that we lacked throughout history about 
                how living organism stsrted to develop. Like astronomers who trace their knowledge to the Big Bang in order to obtain fundamental 
                information about the origin of the universe, biologists hane been researvhing how the molecules in a single went throughsequential and planned changes, how they transformed and acquired 
                new functions that triggered the mind-blowing developments in diverse, miraculous living organisms. Scientists have found out how primordial embryonic cells transformed
                into more than 200 cell type that constitute various tissues and organs.The number of studies has skyrocketed about which molecule types can be used to reenerate te damaged tissuessay, after

                a traffic accidebt.Embryonic studies that focus on the regeneration or reparation of medulla cells (spinal cord) have been a source of hope for some patientswith permanent paralysis because of a broken 
                back injury or severed spine in  a traffic accident or those who are still stranded in wheelchairs.Similarly the 
                preliminary findings of research into parkinson's and diabetes are extremely promising, and a new study reports of two blind people with macular degeneration 
                (which causes blindness) who have been treated.
